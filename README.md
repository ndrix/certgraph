# certgraph

This is a simple D3 "graph" (a hierarchy tree, really) of the most popular websites.  I wanted to scan the top 1 milllion websites, but my PC had a mandatory update; so it restarted over the weekend.  And 60k-ish domains took a few days.

It's a .net core CLI application, should work out of the box.

The blog article on https://michaelhendrickx.com/201911-certgraph:-visualizing-the-distribution-of-trusted-ca's.html will give some background on this.

For any questions, contact me on me@michaelhendrickx.com
